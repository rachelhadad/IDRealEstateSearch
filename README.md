# IDRealEstateSearch

Using a local MLS search website, this program searches for properties with certain criteria. This program was created to help a property flipper find potential properties. 

The criteria listed in the program is specific to the needs of this particular broker, but can be edited very easily.

After properties are found, an email is sent to the "flipper" with pertinent information for each property.

This program utilizes Selenium Webdriver and the Google Gmail API.
